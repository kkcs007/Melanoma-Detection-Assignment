## General Information
- What is the background of your project?

the creation of a CNN-based melanoma detection model. If melanoma is not found in its early stages, it can be fatal. It is responsible for 75% of skin cancer fatalities. A system that can analyse photos and notify dermatologists of the existence of melanoma might potentially eliminate the need for a lot of manual diagnosis work.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?

To model the price of homes with the provided independent variables, a model must be constructed. The management will then utilise this model to determine exactly how the prices fluctuate depending on the variables. As a result, they can influence the company's strategy and concentrate on areas that will provide large returns. The tool will also help management better understand how prices change in a new market.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

The dataset, which was created by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration, has 2357 photos of cancers, both malignant and benign (ISIC).

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
The loss has decreased since the class rebalancing reduces the overfitting of the data.
However the accuracy was reduced to a very low level.

Ultimately, the over fit was reduced using dropout and ImageDataGenerator.

When we tried batch normalisation and augmentation, the results were quite positive.
